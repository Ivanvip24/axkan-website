### Primary Hero Image (Above the Fold)

**File Name**: `hero-main.jpg`
**Dimensions**: 1920x1080px (16:9) or 2400x1350px for retina
**Placement**: Hero section background or floating product showcase

#### Prompt:

```
A cinematic lifestyle photograph of premium Mexican souvenirs arranged artfully on a rustic wooden surface. The scene features laser-cut wooden magnets, keychains, and decorative pieces with intricate Mexican designs (Aztec calendar, hummingbird, geometric patterns).

Lighting: Golden hour warm sunlight streaming from the left, creating soft shadows and highlighting the glossy lacquer finish on the products. Slight bokeh in the background.

Background: Blurred Mexican architectural element — perhaps a terracotta wall with traditional tiles (Talavera), or weathered wood with hints of turquoise paint.

Color palette: Warm terracotta, cream, jade green accents, with products showing magenta, orange, and turquoise details.

Composition: Rule of thirds, products in bottom-left quadrant, negative space in top-right for text overlay.

Mood: Sophisticated, warm, inviting — like a premium lifestyle brand, NOT a tourist shop. Think Kinfolk magazine meets Mexican artisan culture.

Style: Editorial product photography, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), 85mm lens perspective.

AVOID: Sombreros, mustaches, neon colors, cheap plastic look, cluttered composition, harsh lighting.

The person: Hands only visible (inclusive, universal), naturally posed as if they just discovered something precious. Warm skin tones, perhaps wearing a simple linen sleeve.

The product: A premium MDF magnet with glossy finish, showing laser-cut precision details of the Pyramid of the Sun with geometric Maya patterns. Colors: terracotta base with jade green and gold accents.

Background: Dreamy, out-of-focus colonial Mexican street — pastel buildings in coral, ochre, and turquoise. Soft afternoon light.

Lighting: Backlit for a warm glow, golden tones, lens flare acceptable for emotional impact.

Mood: Nostalgic, emotional, like holding a physical piece of a cherished memory. The feeling of "I need to take this home."

Style: Lifestyle documentary photography, warm color grading (slightly desaturated for premium feel), grain texture.

## The AXKAN Visual Test

Before finalizing any image, ask:

1. **Does it trigger pride?** Would a Mexican person feel proud seeing this representation?
2. **Is it culturally authentic?** Does it respect and honor real Mexican traditions?
3. **Is it premium?** Would this feel at home in a museum gift shop or design magazine?
4. **Does it avoid stereotypes?** No sombreros, fake mustaches, or tourist-trap aesthetic?
5. **Does it evoke emotion?** Can you feel the "mariachi moment" — that instant of profound connection?

If any answer is "no," the image needs revision.
